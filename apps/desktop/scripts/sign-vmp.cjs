/*
 * electron-builder `afterPack` hook — castLabs EVS production VMP signing.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * AMP ships the castLabs "Electron for Content Security" fork
 * (electron-releases#vXX+wvcus) so the real Widevine CDM is available. Out of the
 * box that fork carries a DEVELOPMENT VMP (Verified Media Path) signature, and
 * SoundCloud's KeyOS license server rejects development-signed clients with HTTP
 * 403 on the license POST — which is exactly the "specific songs that need
 * Widevine don't play" symptom.
 *
 * The fix is the official, Google-sanctioned path: replace the development VMP
 * signature in the packaged app with a PRODUCTION VMP signature issued by
 * castLabs' free EVS service. This makes our build a properly-certified Widevine
 * client (same mechanism TIDAL Hi-Fi / soundcloud-rpc / BetterSoundCloud use).
 * No DRM is circumvented: content is still only ever decrypted inside the CDM.
 *
 * PREREQUISITE (one-time, run by a human — see apps/desktop/DRM-SIGNING.md):
 *   pip install --upgrade castlabs-evs
 *   python -m castlabs_evs.account signup     # or: reauth
 *
 * This hook runs DURING `electron-builder` (i.e. `pnpm --filter @amp/desktop dist`),
 * after the app is packed into a directory but BEFORE the installer is assembled,
 * so the signature sidecar files get bundled into the installer.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: VMP signatures only apply to PACKAGED builds. `pnpm dev` / `electron .`
 * run unsigned and will still 403 on DRM tracks — test against a packaged build.
 *
 * Escape hatches:
 *   AMP_SKIP_VMP=1        Skip signing entirely (produces an unsigned build
 *                         that will NOT play DRM tracks — dev/CI convenience only).
 *   AMP_EVS_PYTHON=<path> Use a specific Python interpreter for the EVS tool.
 *   (Legacy MUSYNC_-prefixed variants are still honored.)
 *
 * AUTO-REAUTH: EVS auth tokens expire after a week-ish of inactivity, which used to fail
 * the build with NonInteractiveError until someone manually ran `account reauth`. If
 * EVS_ACCOUNT_NAME + EVS_PASSWD are set (env, or apps/desktop/.env.local — git-ignored),
 * a failed sign triggers one non-interactive reauth + retry. CI provides the same pair
 * via repo secrets, so both paths self-heal.

/**
 * Embed AMP's icon (and version/product metadata) into the packaged AMP.exe via rcedit.
 *
 * WHY HERE INSTEAD OF electron-builder's `signAndEditExecutable`:
 * That built-in path unpacks the `winCodeSign` toolchain, whose extraction creates symbolic
 * links and fails on machines without the symlink privilege (non-admin Windows, Developer Mode
 * off). So `signAndEditExecutable` stays false and we run rcedit ourselves — it's a standalone
 * resource editor that needs no symlinks, so it works on both local and CI builds.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS: this runs BEFORE the EVS VMP signing below, so the production VMP signature is
 * computed over the already-icon-edited binary. Editing AFTER signing would invalidate the .sig
 * and break DRM playback.
